1. Epistemic Rationality: systematically improving the accuracy of one’s beliefs
2. Instrumental Rationality: systematically achieving one’s values

Epistemic Rationality is about building accurate maps about the world. One with minimal false beliefs. The correspondence between belief and reality seems to be called “truth”.

Instrumental Rationality is about steering reality. Sometimes called “winning”.

Therefore rationality is about forming true beliefs and making decisions that help you “win”.

Why say “rational” over “truth” or “good”?

We can make a similar argument against why use the world “truth”. Why distinguish “it is true that snow is white” and “snow is white”? The idea of truth is helpful because it leads to the generalization that “true models usually produce better experimental predictions than false models”. Truth is useful for talking about general features of map-territory correspondence/resonance.

“Rational agents make decisions that maximize the probabilistic expectation of a coherent utility function” is a thought that makes use of instrumental rationality. We need “rational” as a concept to note general facts about ways of thinking which systematically produce truth or value—and systematic ways we fall short.

When judging whether a judgement is wrong, experimental psychologists use two gold standards:
1. Probability theory
2. Decision theory

Probability theory is the set of laws underlying rational belief.
Decision theory is the set of laws underlying rational action, which is equally applicable regardless of goals and available options.

P(such-and-such) refers to the probability that “such-and-such” happens.
P(A,B) refers to the probability that both A and B happen.

It is universal law that P(A) ≥ P(A,B). Therefore P(Bill plays jazz) ≥ P(Bill plays jazz, Bill is an accountant).

This is a Bayesian belief, so to say, the belief conforms to a coherent probability distribution, and decisions that maximize the probabilistic expectation of a coherent utility function.

This doesn’t explain in practice fully what is “rationality” for two major reasons:
1. Bayesian formalisms in their full form are basically impossible to calculate and obey with maths. Similar to how no one can predict the stock market with the movements of quarks.
	- There’s an art to finding truth and accomplishing value from within the human mind, which takes more than stating formal axioms on paper.
2. Sometimes the math itself is called into question. Even though we don’t have a perfect model of the world, we still ought to try because regardless we are affected.

As long as we have communicated, that is the purpose of language and word-by-word definitions. All we’re talking about is what is a good way to think.

If one speaks overmuch of the Way, they may not attain it.
